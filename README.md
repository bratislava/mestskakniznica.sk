What's here

🏡 `/next` city-library Nextjs web app

🗄️ `/strapi` Strapi CMS servers (in progress, not here yet)

🐳 `docker-compose.yml` - if you need to quickly setup postgres instance, run `docker compose up` in this directory (you need docker installed) - will be relevant once strapi is available
